### _A CircuitPython Adaptation of Phil Burgess' Fake TV Light For Engineers_

After 5 years of use with the original _Fake TV Light For Engineers_ code, the _NotFlix_ version was upgraded to a Metro M4 running CircuitPython. The conversion to CircuitPython preserves most of the methods and conventions of Phil's original Arduino code. Since RAM space for the _data.h_ array was limited, a file-based version was developed.

For the fun of it, an compact version of _Fake TV_ was developed for the NeoTrinkey using an abbreviated version of the original _data.h_ file, _colors.h_.
