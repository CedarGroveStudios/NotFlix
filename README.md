# Cedar Grove NotFlix

### _A CircuitPython Adaptation of Phil Burgess' Fake TV For Engineers_

After 5 years of use with the original Fake TV For Engineers code, the NotFlix was upgraded to a Metro M4 running CircuitPython. The conversion to CircuitPython preserves most of the methods and conventions of Phil's original Arduino code. Since RAM space for the data.h array was limited, a file-based version was developed.

For the fun of it, an compact version of Fake TV was developed for the NeoTrinkey using an abbreviated version of the original data.h file, colors.h.
